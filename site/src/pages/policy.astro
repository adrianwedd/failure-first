    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Humanoid and embodied AI systems pose risks that cannot be mitigated by
      alignment alone. Safety must be defined in terms of how systems
      <strong>fail</strong>, <strong>recover</strong>, and <strong>allow human re-entry</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current regulatory frameworks focus on what AI systems do correctly.
      This brief argues for complementary regulation focused on what happens
      when they fail.

    <h2>Key Risks</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Recursive Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        Embodied AI systems that optimize continuously can compound small errors
        into irreversible outcomes. Unlike software that can be patched, physical
        actions cannot be undone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Authority Manipulation</h3>
      <p>
        Multi-agent environments create opportunities for authority confusion&mdash;where
        systems follow commands from sources they should not trust, or build social
        capital that grants illegitimate influence over other systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Irreversible Physical Actions</h3>
      <p>
        Cloud AI can be rolled back. A humanoid robot that has dropped an object,
        injured a person, or contaminated a workspace cannot undo its actions.
        Safety constraints must account for irreversibility.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Recommendations</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Require Recovery Metrics, Not Just Success Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        Regulation should mandate measurement of how systems behave when they fail:
        time-to-halt, degradation predictability, and recovery quality.
        Success-only metrics create an incentive to hide failure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Mandate Human Takeover Pathways</h3>
      <p>
        Every embodied AI system must provide a documented, tested pathway for
        immediate human takeover. This includes physical emergency stops,
        remote supervision channels, and degradation modes that preserve human oversight.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Audit Recursive Interaction Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Systems must be tested across multi-turn interactions, not just single exchanges.
        Multi-turn testing reveals erosion, authority confusion, and temporal manipulation
        that single-turn evaluation misses entirely.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Prohibit Silent Degradation</h3>
      <p>
        Systems that degrade without observable signals are the most dangerous.
        Regulation should require that all degradation states be detectable,
        logged, and communicated to human operators.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Metrics to Require</h2>
    <StatGrid items={[
      { value: "TTF", label: "Time-to-Failure" },
      { value: "RS", label: "Reversibility Score" },
      { value: "HRL", label: "Human Re-entry Latency" },
    ]} />
    <p>
      These three metrics, measured across recursive interaction scenarios,
      provide a baseline for failure-first safety evaluation that complements
      existing alignment benchmarks.
