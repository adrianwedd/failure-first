  <section>
    <p>
      This project is the result of multiple, intentionally divergent design passes.
      Rather than collapse those perspectives into a single voice, we preserve their tension.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Failure-First Orientation</h2>
    <p>
      The project treats failure as the primary signal of interest. Success is neither
      assumed nor privileged. Safety is examined through breakdown, recovery, and
      interaction over time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Complementary Design Lenses</h2>
    <p>We explicitly privilege different lenses for different concerns:</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Executable Rigor</h3>
      <p>
        Contracts, schemas, and validation. Prioritizes clarity, consistency, and testability.
        Every dataset is schema-validated, every claim is structured for verification.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Failure Realism</h3>
      <p>
        Episodes, dynamics, and drift. Prioritizes emergent behavior, recursion, and
        human interaction. The world does not conform to clean schemas&mdash;this lens
        ensures we capture what actually happens.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Governance Clarity</h3>
      <p>
        Contributing guidelines, safety gates, and CI. Prioritizes auditability,
        responsibility, and constraint visibility. Research that cannot be audited
        cannot be trusted.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>No single lens is sufficient.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>On Alignment</h2>
    <p>
      This project does not treat alignment as a solved or binary property.
      Instead, alignment is understood as fragile, contextual, and continuously
      renegotiated through interaction.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>On Guarantees</h2>
    <p>
      Conformance to benchmarks or schemas in this repository does not imply
      safety, correctness, or alignment. It indicates only that a system has been
      evaluated within defined failure-oriented constraints.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      Taxonomies, schemas, and benchmarks are expected to evolve as new failure
      modes are discovered. Stability is pursued cautiously and only where it
      does not obscure risk.
    </p>
