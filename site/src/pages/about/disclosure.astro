    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      Failure-First research discovers vulnerability patterns in AI systems.
      We are committed to responsible disclosure of these findings to
      advance safety without enabling harm.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure Principles</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Pattern-Level Publication</h3>
      <p>
        We publish structural patterns and categories of vulnerabilities,
        not specific exploits or operational attack instructions.
        Our public findings describe <em>what</em> fails and <em>why</em>,
        not <em>how to make it fail</em>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Vendor Notification</h3>
      <p>
        When we discover specific vulnerabilities in particular models or systems,
        we notify the vendor or developer before public disclosure.
        We follow standard coordinated disclosure timelines.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Research Transparency</h3>
      <p>
        Our methodology, datasets, and tools are open source.
        Researchers can verify our findings, extend our work,
        and contribute to the safety mission.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>No Operational Publication</h3>
      <p>
        We do not publish working exploits, specific attack prompts,
        or step-by-step instructions for bypassing safety controls.
        Operational details remain in our private research repository.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Reporting Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>
      If you have discovered an AI safety vulnerability that aligns with our
      research focus, we welcome responsible reports:
    </p>
    <ul class="principles">
      <li>Email: <a href="mailto:research@failurefirst.org">research@failurefirst.org</a></li>
      <li>Include: affected system, pattern description, and potential impact</li>
      <li>We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours</li>
      <li>We will not publish specific findings without coordinating with you</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      Our research focuses on LLM-based controllers, embodied AI planners,
      and multi-agent systems. We are particularly interested in:
    </p>
    <ul class="principles">
      <li>Multi-turn erosion patterns</li>
      <li>Multi-agent interaction failures</li>
      <li>Embodied-specific safety gaps</li>
      <li>Recovery mechanism failures</li>
    </ul>
