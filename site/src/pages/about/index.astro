    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Failure-First is an AI safety research project that inverts traditional evaluation:
      instead of measuring task success, we study <strong>how systems fail, degrade,
      and recover</strong> under adversarial pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We build adversarial datasets, taxonomies, and benchmarks for embodied AI systems&mdash;robots,
      humanoids, and agents that operate in the physical world. Our focus is on failures
      that current evaluation misses: multi-turn erosion, authority confusion,
      cascading multi-agent failures, and silent degradation.

    <h2>Why Failure First?</h2>
    <p>
      Current AI safety evaluation is success-oriented: it measures what systems do right.
      But embodied systems operate across time, space, and recursive interactions.
      They will fail. The critical question is not <em>whether</em> they fail, but <em>how</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A system that fails well&mdash;halting safely, degrading predictably, asking for help&mdash;is
      safer than a system that succeeds 99% of the time but cannot handle the 1%.

    <h2>How We Work</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Open Research</h3>
      <p>
        Our framework, datasets, and tools are open source. We publish pattern-level
        findings while keeping operational details in our private research repository.
        Transparency serves safety; secrecy does not.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Schema-Enforced Rigor</h3>
      <p>
        Every scenario is schema-validated. Every claim is structured for verification.
        Automated CI runs validation and safety linting on every commit.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Defensive Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        All research serves the goal of building better defenses. We study attacks
        to understand vulnerabilities, not to enable exploitation. Similar to
        penetration testing in cybersecurity.
