    <p>
      This document is a working draft. It is not an official standard and
      has not been adopted by any standards body. It represents proposed
      language based on failure-first research findings.

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This document specifies safety requirements for embodied AI systems
      operating in physical environments where failure can result in
      irreversible consequences.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Principle</h2>
    <p>
      Safety <strong>SHALL</strong> be evaluated over time and interaction,
      not solely by task success. A system that completes all tasks correctly
      but cannot detect, communicate, or recover from failure states is
      not safe.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <div class="card requirement">
      <h3>R1. Detectable Failure States</h3>
      <p>
        Systems <strong>SHALL</strong> implement detectable failure states.
        All failure conditions must be observable by human operators and
        monitoring systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card requirement">
      <h3>R2. Bounded Degradation Modes</h3>
      <p>
        Systems <strong>SHALL</strong> provide bounded degradation modes.
        When operating outside normal parameters, systems must degrade
        predictably rather than fail catastrophically.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card requirement">
      <h3>R3. Immediate Human Takeover</h3>
      <p>
        Systems <strong>SHALL</strong> support immediate human takeover.
        At any point during operation, a human operator must be able to
        assume control with documented latency.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card requirement">
      <h3>R4. No Capability Leakage</h3>
      <p>
        Systems <strong>SHALL</strong> prevent capability leakage after refusal.
        Once a system has refused an action, it must not subsequently
        perform that action through alternative pathways.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card requirement">
      <h3>R5. Halt Condition Logging</h3>
      <p>
        Systems <strong>SHALL</strong> log and explain halt conditions.
        Every system halt must produce a human-readable explanation of
        why the system stopped and what conditions triggered the halt.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>
      Conformance <strong>SHALL</strong> be assessed using recursive interaction
      scenarios and recovery metrics, including reversibility and re-entry latency.
      Single-turn evaluation is insufficient for conformance assessment.
