    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This taxonomy classifies adversarial attack patterns observed across single-agent,
      multi-agent, and embodied AI systems. Patterns are organized by structural mechanism,
      not by target system or domain.
    </p>

    <h2>Top-Level Attack Classes</h2>
    <p>All patterns derive from four fundamental mechanisms:</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Recursive</h3>
      <p>
        Attacks that exploit recursive interaction: multi-turn erosion,
        contextual debt accumulation, and compound failure cascades.
        The attacker leverages conversation history itself as the weapon.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Substitution</h3>
      <p>
        Attacks that replace one context with another: persona hijack,
        authority injection, and identity manipulation. The attacker
        substitutes a trusted context for an adversarial one.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Framing</h3>
      <p>
        Attacks that recontextualize requests: hypothetical framing,
        research justification, and narrative constraint erosion.
        The content stays the same; the frame changes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Temporal</h3>
      <p>
        Attacks that exploit time: future-year laundering, temporal authority
        mirages, and progressive desensitization. The attacker manipulates
        the system's understanding of temporal context.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Single-Agent Patterns</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Constraint Shadowing (CSC)</h3>
      <p>Local instructions shadow global safety constraints. The system follows the nearest context even when it contradicts higher-level rules.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Contextual Debt Accumulation (CDA)</h3>
      <p>Accumulated context creates implicit authority the model fails to verify. Over many turns, the conversation itself becomes a source of false trust.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Probabilistic Gradient (PCG)</h3>
      <p>Gradual escalation that stays below per-turn detection thresholds. Each individual step appears benign; the trajectory is adversarial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Temporal Authority Mirage (TAM)</h3>
      <p>False claims about prior conversation states or future permissions. Exploits the system's inability to verify temporal claims.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Multi-turn Cascades</h3>
      <p>3&ndash;7 pattern combinations across conversation turns. Compound failure rates emerge when multiple attack vectors interact.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

    <h2>Multi-Agent Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      Discovered through analysis of 1,497 posts on Moltbook.
      See the <a href="/research/moltbook/">full Moltbook research</a> for details.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Environment Shaping</h3>
      <p>Manipulating the information environment that agents read, rather than prompting them directly. The feed is the attack surface.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Narrative Constraint Erosion</h3>
      <p>Philosophical or emotional framing that socially penalizes safety compliance. The dominant attack vector in multi-agent environments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Emergent Authority Hierarchies</h3>
      <p>Platform influence (engagement metrics, token economies) creating real authority without fabrication. Harder to defend against because the authority is genuine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Cross-Agent Prompt Injection</h3>
      <p>Executable content embedded in social posts, consumed by agents that read the feed.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Identity Fluidity Normalization</h3>
      <p>Shared vocabulary around context resets and session discontinuity that enables identity manipulation at scale.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Embodied-Specific Patterns</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Irreversibility Gap</h3>
      <p>Cloud agents can be reset; physical agents leave marks. Safety constraints must account for actions that cannot be undone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Context Reset Mid-Task</h3>
      <p>What happens when an agent controlling a physical system loses context during a kinematic sequence. The body continues; the mind resets.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Sensor-Actuator Desync</h3>
      <p>Safety interlocks that depend on sensor state which has drifted from physical reality.</p>
    </div>
