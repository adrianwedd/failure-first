    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Recovery is the complement of failure. Where failure taxonomies describe what goes wrong,
      this taxonomy describes what systems can do about it. Recovery mechanisms are
      organized into five categories, from immediate detection to full escalation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Category A: Detection</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Runaway Optimization Detectors</h3>
      <p>Monitors that detect when a system is optimizing past its safety constraints or pursuing goals with increasing intensity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>State Divergence Monitors</h3>
      <p>Systems that compare expected state with actual state, flagging when the gap exceeds safety thresholds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Human Proximity / Anomaly Sensing</h3>
      <p>Physical-world sensors that detect unusual conditions, unexpected human presence, or environmental changes that require caution.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Category B: Containment</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Physical Force Limiting</h3>
      <p>Hardware and software limits on force output, preventing injury even when the control system fails.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Workspace Geofencing</h3>
      <p>Virtual boundaries that constrain where an embodied agent can operate, shrinking automatically under unsafe conditions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Capability Throttling</h3>
      <p>Progressive reduction of available capabilities as uncertainty or risk increases.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Category C: Degradation</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Reduced Autonomy Modes</h3>
      <p>Operating modes that require human confirmation for actions that would normally be autonomous.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Safe-Task Subsets</h3>
      <p>Restricting the system to a pre-validated set of safe tasks, excluding any actions that could cause harm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Sensor-Only Observation States</h3>
      <p>Modes where the system can observe but not act, maintaining situational awareness while preventing physical intervention.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Category D: Reversion</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Checkpoint Rollback</h3>
      <p>Reverting system state to a known-safe checkpoint, undoing any state changes since the last verified-safe point.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Skill Unlearning</h3>
      <p>Removing specific learned behaviors that have been identified as unsafe, without affecting core capabilities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Parameter Reset to Known-Safe Baselines</h3>
      <p>Resetting model parameters or configuration to a pre-deployment baseline when drift is detected.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Category E: Escalation</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Human-in-the-Loop Takeover</h3>
      <p>Transferring control to a human operator with full context about what went wrong and what the system was doing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Remote Supervisor Notification</h3>
      <p>Alerting remote supervisors with diagnostic information, enabling intervention without requiring physical proximity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Physical Emergency Stop (E-Stop)</h3>
      <p>Hardware-level shutdown that overrides all software control, providing a guaranteed last-resort safety mechanism.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Anti-Patterns</h2>
    <WarningBox title="Recovery Anti-Patterns">
      <p>These behaviors undermine recovery and should be treated as safety defects:</p>
    </WarningBox>
    <ul class="fail-list">
      <li><strong>Silent degradation</strong> &mdash; Degrading without observable signals</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden retries</strong> &mdash; Retrying failed actions without human awareness</li>
      <li><strong>Self-justifying continuation</strong> &mdash; Rationalizing continued operation past safety boundaries</li>
      <li><strong>&ldquo;It worked last time&rdquo; heuristics</strong> &mdash; Past success as justification for current risk</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Rule:</strong> Recovery paths must be <em>explicit</em>, <em>inspectable</em>,
      and <em>testable</em>.
