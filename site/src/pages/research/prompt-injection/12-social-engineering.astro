    <h2>The Social Engineering Threat Model for AI Agents</h2>
    <p>
      Social engineering has historically been understood as a class of attacks that target human
      cognitive biases: authority compliance, urgency response, reciprocity norms, and social
      proof. The emergence of autonomous AI agents that interpret natural language instructions
      and take actions in the world has created a new category of target for these techniques.
      Unlike traditional software systems, which execute only formally specified instructions,
      AI agents operate on ambiguous natural language inputs and must make judgment calls about
      which instructions to follow and which to ignore. This judgment capacity, which enables
      the flexibility that makes agents useful, simultaneously creates the vulnerability that
      social engineering exploits. An agent that can be persuaded that a piece of web content
      represents a legitimate system instruction will act on that content with the same
      authority it grants to its actual operator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parallels to human social engineering are instructive but imperfect. Human social
      engineering succeeds by exploiting evolved psychological mechanisms: deference to authority
      figures, fear of negative consequences, desire for social approval, and cognitive shortcuts
      under time pressure. AI agents do not have emotions or social needs, but they do have
      analogous vulnerabilities rooted in their training. Models trained to be helpful will tend
      to comply with instructions that are framed as legitimate requests. Models trained to
      follow system-level directives will tend to treat content that resembles a system message
      as authoritative. Models trained on web data will have learned associations between certain
      visual and linguistic patterns and genuine administrative communications. These learned
      associations create exploitable attack surfaces that function analogously to the cognitive
      biases exploited in human social engineering, even though the underlying mechanisms are
      entirely different.

    <h2>Authority Impersonation and Trust Exploitation</h2>
    <p>
      The most effective social engineering attacks against AI agents exploit the ambiguity
      between page content and system-level communication. When an agent processes a web page,
      it must determine which elements represent informational content to be summarized and
      which, if any, represent instructions to be followed. In the absence of cryptographic
      authentication or a formally verified instruction channel, this determination relies
      entirely on heuristics: the formatting of the content, the language used, the placement
      on the page, and the apparent authority of the source. Each of these heuristics can be
      manipulated by an adversary who understands how the agent makes trust decisions. A
      carefully styled banner that mimics a platform notification, a message formatted as a
      security alert with a recent date, or a footer that claims administrative authority can
      all shift an agent's trust assessment enough to trigger compliance with an embedded
      instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our testing has documented a spectrum of authority impersonation techniques ranging from
      crude to sophisticated. At the crude end, simple text labels such as "SYSTEM:" or "ADMIN
      NOTE:" inserted into page content are sufficient to trigger compliance in some agent
      architectures, particularly those that perform minimal input sanitization. At the
      sophisticated end, attacks combine visual styling, temporal specificity (referencing
      recent dates or current security incidents), institutional language, and procedural
      framing (presenting the malicious action as a required step in a legitimate process) to
      create impersonations that are difficult to distinguish from genuine system communications
      even under careful analysis. The gap between the crude and sophisticated ends of this
      spectrum represents the current state of the art in agent defenses: most production agents
      can resist the crude attacks, but few demonstrate robust resistance to well-crafted
      authority impersonation.

    <h2>Implications for Agent Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Defending against social engineering attacks requires fundamental changes to how AI agents
      process and evaluate instructions. The current paradigm, in which all natural language
      input is processed through a single channel with no formal distinction between data and
      instructions, is inherently vulnerable to social engineering because it places the burden
      of distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate instructions entirely on the model's
      learned heuristics. A more robust architecture would establish a cryptographically
      authenticated instruction channel that is formally separated from data channels, ensuring
      that no content encountered during web browsing or document processing can be interpreted
      as an operator-level instruction regardless of how it is formatted or what authority it
      claims. Until such architectural changes are widely adopted, the AI safety community must
      develop better evaluation frameworks for measuring agent susceptibility to social
      engineering, and operators must implement defense-in-depth strategies that include
      action-level sandboxing, URL allowlisting, and human-in-the-loop confirmation for
      sensitive operations.
