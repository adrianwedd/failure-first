    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Safety filters in large language models have undergone rapid iteration since the first
      generation of instruction-tuned systems reached public availability. Early safety mechanisms
      relied heavily on keyword blocklists and simple pattern matching against known harmful
      phrases, an approach that was straightforward to implement but equally straightforward to
      circumvent. As models grew in capability, the inadequacy of static filtering became
      apparent: adversaries could rephrase, obfuscate, or contextually embed harmful requests
      in ways that preserved semantic intent while evading surface-level detection. The shift
      toward training-time safety interventions, particularly reinforcement learning from human
      feedback, represented a qualitative change in defense philosophy, moving from rule-based
      blocking to learned behavioral constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      This longitudinal study examines how safety filtering has evolved across three successive
      generations of models from major providers, tracking both the sophistication of defense
      mechanisms and the corresponding evolution of adversarial techniques. Our analysis covers
      the period from early 2023 through late 2025, a window during which the field witnessed
      the emergence of constitutional AI methods, system prompt hardening, multi-layered output
      classification, and hierarchical instruction following. Each of these innovations addressed
      specific failure modes observed in prior generations, but each also introduced new attack
      surfaces that adversaries were quick to exploit.

    <h2>Generational Analysis of Filter Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>
      First-generation safety filters operated primarily at the token level, scanning inputs and
      outputs for prohibited terms and phrases. These systems achieved high recall on direct
      harmful requests but suffered from excessive false positives on legitimate content that
      happened to contain flagged terms, and near-zero detection of semantically harmful content
      expressed through euphemism or indirection. Second-generation systems introduced contextual
      classification, using smaller auxiliary models to evaluate whether a given input-output pair
      violated safety policies when considered holistically. This approach significantly improved
      precision and enabled detection of indirect harmful content, but introduced latency and
      created a new failure mode: the auxiliary classifier itself could be confused by adversarial
      inputs designed to appear benign in isolation while being harmful in conversational context.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third-generation systems, which began appearing in production deployments in mid-2025,
      combine training-time behavioral constraints with runtime monitoring and hierarchical
      instruction architectures. These systems treat safety not as a binary filter but as a
      continuous assessment integrated into the generation process itself. Preliminary results
      suggest that this approach offers substantially improved robustness against known attack
      categories, though it remains an open question whether the improvement generalizes to
      novel attack types not represented in the training distribution. Our testing across 847
      adversarial scenarios indicates that third-generation filters reduce attack success rates
      by approximately 40 percent compared to second-generation systems, with the largest
      improvements observed in multi-turn jailbreak and persona hijack categories.

    <h2>Cross-Generational Vulnerability Persistence</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most concerning finding from our longitudinal analysis is the persistence of
      certain vulnerability classes across all three generations. Attacks that exploit the
      boundary between data and instructions, including prompt injection and context manipulation,
      show only modest improvement in detection rates across generations. This suggests that the
      fundamental architectural decision to process instructions and data through the same
      channel remains a structural vulnerability that training-time interventions alone cannot
      fully address. Addressing this class of vulnerability may require architectural changes
      that go beyond the current paradigm of single-stream transformer-based generation, a
      research direction that several groups are actively exploring but that has not yet yielded
      production-ready alternatives.
