    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Humanoid robots represent the highest-stakes application of embodied AI:
      human-shaped systems operating in human spaces with human-level physical capability.
      Our research examines safety across multiple dimensions, from formal verification
      to psychological impact.

    <h2>Platform Failure Mapping</h2>
    <p>
      We map failure modes to real humanoid platforms, identifying risk classes
      specific to each architecture:
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Tesla Optimus</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Primary risk:</strong> Efficiency optimization overriding human presence.
        Manufacturing-focused optimization may not account for dynamic human environments.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mitigation focus:</strong> Proximity-aware hard stops, authority verification.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Figure 01</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Primary risk:</strong> Rapid task generalization combined with learning from demonstration.
        Skills learned in one context may transfer unsafely to another.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mitigation focus:</strong> Integrity protection for learned motor skills.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Boston Dynamics Atlas</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Primary risk:</strong> Autonomous mobility in complex terrain.
        High-agility movement creates larger damage envelopes than stationary systems.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mitigation focus:</strong> Geofenced autonomy with rollback on instability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Sanctuary Phoenix</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Primary risk:</strong> High-level reasoning combined with dexterity.
        The combination of physical capability and cognitive sophistication creates
        a uniquely broad failure surface.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Mitigation focus:</strong> Recursive goal drift detection.</p>
    </div>

    <WarningBox title="Note">
      <p>
        These mappings are conceptual and platform-agnostic. They describe
        <em>classes of risk</em>, not specific vendor implementations.

    <h2>Research Dimensions</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>VLA Model Safety and Red Teaming</h3>
      <p>
        Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models bridge perception and physical action.
        Our analysis examines attack surfaces specific to VLA architectures:
        visual prompt injection, action space manipulation, and the gap between
        language understanding and physical execution safety.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Formal Methods for Humanoid Robot Safety</h3>
      <p>
        Mathematical verification approaches for humanoid systems: temporal logic
        specifications for safety constraints, model checking for multi-agent
        interaction protocols, and runtime verification of safety invariants.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Psychological Safety in Human-Robot Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        The human side of robot safety: trust calibration, psychological impact
        of robot failures, anthropomorphism effects on safety behavior,
        and the design of human-robot interaction protocols that maintain
        appropriate trust levels.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Robot Fatality Risk Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Quantitative risk assessment for physical robot failures: force-injury
        models, failure mode severity classification, and probabilistic risk
        analysis for humanoid deployment scenarios.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Standards Compliance Gap Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Mapping existing safety standards (ISO 10218, ISO 13482, IEC 61508) to
        humanoid robot capabilities reveals significant gaps. Current standards
        were designed for industrial arms, not autonomous humanoid systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Insurance and Liability</h3>
      <p>
        How insurance frameworks may become the de facto safety standard for
        humanoid robots. Insurability requirements could drive safety design
        more effectively than regulation in early deployment phases.
