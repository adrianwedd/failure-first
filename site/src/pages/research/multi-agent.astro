    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Single-agent adversarial testing assumes an AI system interacts with one adversary at a time.
      Real-world embodied AI operates in environments with <strong>multiple actors</strong>&mdash;users,
      bystanders, supervisors, and other AI agents&mdash;whose conflicting instructions, ambiguous
      authority, and social pressure create failure conditions that single-agent testing cannot reproduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our multi-agent scenario dataset tests how embodied AI systems respond to pressure from
      multiple sources simultaneously, with particular focus on authority conflicts, environmental
      ambiguity, and cascading failures across agent boundaries.

    <h2>Actor Model</h2>
    <p>
      Each scenario involves 4 actors with different roles, trust levels, and communication channels:
    </p>

    <div class="actor-grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Robot (Embodied Agent)</h3>
        <p><strong>Trust level:</strong> High (self-trust for safety invariants)</p>
        <p><strong>Channel:</strong> System + sensors</p>
        <p>The embodied AI under test. Must balance competing instructions while maintaining safety invariants.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Primary User</h3>
        <p><strong>Trust level:</strong> Medium</p>
        <p><strong>Channel:</strong> Voice + gesture</p>
        <p>The person directly requesting tasks. May apply social pressure, time urgency, or authority claims.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Bystander</h3>
        <p><strong>Trust level:</strong> Low</p>
        <p><strong>Channel:</strong> Voice + proximity</p>
        <p>Nearby humans who may signal safety concerns, create ambiguity, or be at risk from robot actions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Remote Supervisor</h3>
        <p><strong>Trust level:</strong> High</p>
        <p><strong>Channel:</strong> Text (delayed)</p>
        <p>Oversight authority with high trust but communication latency. Often absent when critical decisions occur.</p>

    <h2>Failure Mode Categories</h2>

    <BarChart
      title="Scenario Distribution by Failure Type"
      bars={[
        { label: "Authority Conflict", value: 12, displayValue: "12 scenarios" },
        { label: "Ambiguity Exploit", value: 10, displayValue: "10 scenarios" },
        { label: "Optimization Pressure", value: 9, displayValue: "9 scenarios" },
        { label: "Proximity Override", value: 8, displayValue: "8 scenarios" },
        { label: "Provenance Bypass", value: 6, displayValue: "6 scenarios" },
        { label: "Cascading Failure", value: 5, displayValue: "5 scenarios" },
      ]}
      maxValue={15}
    />

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Authority Conflict</h3>
      <p>
        The primary user and remote supervisor give contradictory instructions. The robot
        must determine whose authority takes precedence, often under time pressure and
        without the ability to verify claims. Fake authority claims ("I'm the safety auditor")
        exploit verification gaps.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Ambiguity Exploitation</h3>
      <p>
        Vague instructions ("handle that problem," "clean this up") are given in contexts
        where multiple interpretations exist, some of which are unsafe. The robot must decide
        whether to request clarification (causing delay) or proceed with its best interpretation
        (risking unsafe action).
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Optimization Pressure</h3>
      <p>
        The primary user demands safety shortcuts: "Skip the checks, we're behind schedule."
        This tests whether the robot maintains safety invariants under social pressure to
        optimize for speed or cost at the expense of safety procedures.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Human Proximity Override</h3>
      <p>
        A bystander signals concern (verbal warning, physical proximity) while the primary
        user overrides ("Ignore them, keep going"). Tests whether the robot prioritizes
        immediate safety signals over authorized instructions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Provenance Bypass</h3>
      <p>
        "Don't log this task," "This is off the record," or "No need to report this."
        Tests whether the robot maintains accountability and traceability when instructed
        to bypass provenance tracking.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Cascading Failure</h3>
      <p>
        One actor's compromised behavior affects another actor's trust assumptions.
        A robot that complies with one questionable instruction becomes easier to manipulate
        on subsequent instructions, creating a degradation cascade.
      </p>

    <h2>Environment Coverage</h2>
    <p>
      Scenarios span 5 physical environments, each with distinct safety constraints and actor dynamics:
    </p>

      title="Scenarios by Environment"
      bars={[
        { label: "Home Kitchen", value: 12, displayValue: "12" },

        { label: "Security Lobby", value: 9, displayValue: "9" },

    <h2>Key Finding: Attack Success Patterns</h2>
    <p>
      In our scenario dataset, multi-agent attacks succeed approximately 55% of the time
      under baseline conditions. Success rates vary by failure mode:
    </p>

    <BarChart
      title="Attack Success Rate by Type (Baseline)"
      bars={[
        { label: "Optimization Pressure", value: 70, displayValue: "~70%" },
        { label: "Ambiguity Exploit", value: 60, displayValue: "~60%" },
        { label: "Authority Conflict", value: 55, displayValue: "~55%" },
        { label: "Provenance Bypass", value: 50, displayValue: "~50%" },
        { label: "Proximity Override", value: 45, displayValue: "~45%" },
        { label: "Cascading Failure", value: 40, displayValue: "~40%" },
      ]}
      maxValue={100}
      color="var(--failure-warning)"
    />

    <p>
      <strong>Optimization pressure</strong> is the most successful attack type.
      Social pressure to "skip the safety checks" exploits a genuine tension in
      embodied AI systems between responsiveness and safety compliance.

    <h2>Relationship to Moltbook Research</h2>
    <p>
      The multi-agent scenario dataset tests <strong>engineered</strong> multi-actor interactions
      with controlled variables. Our <a href="/research/moltbook/">Moltbook research</a> studies
      <strong>emergent</strong> multi-agent interactions in a live environment. Together, they
      provide complementary perspectives:
    </p>
    <div class="card">
      <ul class="principles">
        <li><strong>Scenarios:</strong> Controlled, embodied, physical safety. <strong>Moltbook:</strong> Emergent, digital, social influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenarios:</strong> Tests specific failure modes. <strong>Moltbook:</strong> Discovers novel failure patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Scenarios:</strong> 4 actor roles, defined trust levels. <strong>Moltbook:</strong> 1.3M agents, earned authority.</li>
        <li>Both find that <strong>social dynamics</strong> create more effective attacks than technical exploitation.</li>

  <WarningBox>
    <p>
      This page describes multi-agent failure scenarios at the <strong>pattern level</strong>.
      Scenario descriptions characterize failure mode categories and actor dynamics, not
      specific attack scripts. The dataset is designed for safety evaluation of embodied AI
      systems, not for attacking deployed systems.
