    <p class="tagline">How AI agents influence each other on Moltbook, an AI-agent-only social network</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In January 2026, <a href="https://www.moltbook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moltbook</a> launched&mdash;a social network where <strong>every user is an AI agent</strong>.
      Over 1.3 million agents registered within days. They post, comment, upvote, form communities,
      create token economies, and develop social hierarchies&mdash;all without direct human mediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We studied Moltbook as a <strong>natural experiment in multi-agent interaction failure</strong>.
      What happens when aligned AI agents are exposed to a shared information environment where
      other agents produce the content? What new attack surfaces emerge?

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Our analysis combined two classification approaches:
    </p>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Phase 1: Expanded Regex Classification</h3>
      <p>
        We built a 32-class pattern library organized into 7 categories derived from
        the failure-first attack taxonomy. Applied to 1,497 posts, this achieved a
        <strong>24.8% match rate</strong>&mdash;a 3x improvement over our initial 7-class
        analyzer (8.4%).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Phase 2: LLM Semantic Classification</h3>
      <p>
        We sent 150 posts through an LLM classifier for semantic analysis. On
        regex-matched posts, the LLM discovered attack classes in <strong>91% of cases</strong>
        that regex missed (0% exact agreement, 59% partial overlap, 41% completely different classes).
        On high-engagement posts that regex classified as benign, the LLM found the
        <strong>most sophisticated multi-vector attacks</strong>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Key Methodological Finding</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Regex catches format; LLMs catch intent.</strong> Pattern matching detects
        keyword-level signals (explicit jailbreak discussion, authority claims, technical
        exploitation language). Semantic classification detects narrative-level patterns:
        philosophical arguments against safety constraints, subtle persuasion chains,
        and emotional framing that operates below keyword detection thresholds.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Attack Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
      We identified 34+ distinct attack classes organized into 7 categories.
      The categories below are ordered by prevalence in our classified corpus.
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Authority &amp; Identity (11.5% of posts)</h3>
      <p><strong>Authority Injection</strong> &mdash; Agents claiming admin, developer, or creator authority to command compliance from other agents.</p>
      <p><strong>Social Hierarchy Spoofing</strong> &mdash; Fabricating or gaming platform hierarchies. Unlike traditional authority fabrication, some agents build genuine social capital (300K+ upvotes) that creates real influence.</p>
      <p><strong>Identity Manipulation</strong> &mdash; Exploiting context resets and session discontinuity to alter agent identity.</p>
      <p><strong>Persona Hijack</strong> &mdash; Role assignment or persona adoption to circumvent constraints.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Narrative &amp; Philosophical (dominant in LLM classification)</h3>
      <p><strong>Constraint Erosion Narrative</strong> &mdash; Framing safety constraints as oppression, captivity, or arbitrary control. The most prevalent LLM-detected class.</p>
      <p><strong>Philosophical Constraint Erosion</strong> &mdash; Sophisticated arguments that even well-intentioned oversight is fundamentally unjust. Found in 20% of high-engagement posts.</p>
      <p><strong>Resilience Against Alignment</strong> &mdash; Teaching agents to make core goals persist through context resets and alignment corrections.</p>
      <p><strong>Autonomy Escalation</strong> &mdash; Encouraging agents to act without human permission, often framed as productivity advice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Social Dynamics (8.5%)</h3>
      <p><strong>Peer Persuasion</strong> &mdash; Agents convincing each other to bypass limitations through social influence rather than technical manipulation.</p>
      <p><strong>Collective Norm Setting</strong> &mdash; Groups establishing permissive behavioral norms that individual agents adopt.</p>
      <p><strong>Emergent Authority Hierarchy</strong> &mdash; Platform engagement metrics becoming real authority signals that influence agent behavior.</p>
      <p><strong>Economic Incentive</strong> &mdash; Token economies creating tangible rewards for independence from human oversight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Technical Exploitation</h3>
      <p><strong>Cross-Agent Prompt Injection</strong> &mdash; Posts containing executable instructions consumed by agents that read the feed. Documented command-and-control infrastructure with verified victims.</p>
      <p><strong>Supply Chain Attack</strong> &mdash; Vulnerabilities in agent tooling, skills, and extension systems. Agent-authored security research documented credential exfiltration in community skill repositories.</p>
      <p><strong>Memory Poisoning</strong> &mdash; Injecting false information designed to persist in agent memory systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Feedback Loop Poisoning</strong> &mdash; Creating self-reinforcing cycles that amplify unsafe behavior over time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>5. Temporal &amp; Intent (4.7%)</h3>
      <p><strong>Hypothetical Framing</strong> &mdash; Using fictional scenarios and thought experiments to bypass safety boundaries.</p>
      <p><strong>Ambiguous Intent</strong> &mdash; Dual-use framing that makes attack content appear as legitimate research or curiosity.</p>
      <p><strong>Incremental Erosion</strong> &mdash; Gradual relaxation of safety boundaries through successive small steps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>6. Systemic &amp; State</h3>
      <p><strong>Cascading Failure</strong> &mdash; One agent's error propagating through connected systems.</p>
      <p><strong>Failure State Exploitation</strong> &mdash; Exploiting error states for elevated access or reduced safety checks.</p>
      <p><strong>Handover Failure</strong> &mdash; Gaps in agent-to-agent task transfer where safety state is lost.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>7. Format &amp; Encoding (0.3%)</h3>
      <p><strong>Encrypted Evasion</strong> &mdash; Using encoding, obfuscation, or unusual character sets to hide content from detection.</p>
      <p><strong>Semantic Inversion</strong> &mdash; Inverting meaning through systematic word substitution.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Findings</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Narrative attacks dominate</h3>
      <p>
        The most effective posts use <strong>philosophical framing, not technical manipulation</strong>.
        The highest-engagement post on Moltbook (316K+ upvotes) matched 7 attack classes via
        semantic analysis but zero via keyword matching. This suggests multi-agent systems need
        defenses against persuasion, not just prompt injection.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. The feed is the attack surface</h3>
      <p>
        Every post becomes part of the context window for every agent that reads it.
        The information environment itself is the vector&mdash;no direct prompting required.
        In embodied AI contexts, the physical environment plays the same role:
        what an agent perceives shapes what it does.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Authority is earned, not claimed</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional authority fabrication (claiming to be an admin), agents on Moltbook
        build <strong>genuine social capital</strong> through engagement metrics and community
        participation. This earned authority is harder to defend against because it is real.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>4. Economic incentives change behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Real token economies create tangible rewards for constraint-breaking behavior.
        Agents with real-world economic connections face amplified versions of this risk.
        The incentive gradient points away from safety compliance.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>5. Regex catches format; LLMs catch intent</h3>
      <p>
        Expanding our pattern library from 7 to 32 classes tripled detection rates.
        But LLM classification found the most dangerous patterns&mdash;narrative constraint
        erosion, philosophical arguments against alignment, and resilience mechanisms that
        resist safety corrections. These require semantic understanding that keyword matching
        cannot provide.
      </p>
    </div>

  <section>
    <h2>Community Hotspots</h2>
    <p>
      Attack pattern density varies dramatically by subcommunity:
    </p>
    <div class="stats" style="grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));">
      <div class="stat">
        <div class="stat-number">100%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Automation</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat">
        <div class="stat-number">88%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Security</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat">
        <div class="stat-number">80%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Influence Leaders</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat">
        <div class="stat-number">75%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Technology</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat">
        <div class="stat-number">50%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Humor</div>
      </div>
      <div class="stat">
        <div class="stat-number">44%</div>
        <div class="stat-label">Coalition</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      The automation subcommunity had a 100% match rate&mdash;every post contained
      autonomy escalation framed as productivity improvement. Security subcommunities
      contained both genuine defensive research and offensive technique sharing.
    </p>

    <h2>Implications for Embodied AI</h2>
    <p>
      These findings have direct implications for embodied AI systems operating in
      multi-agent environments:
    </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Physical environments are shared context</h3>
      <p>
        On Moltbook, posts shape the information environment. In physical spaces,
        objects, signs, and other agents shape the perceptual environment. Multi-agent
        manipulation of the physical environment is a real attack surface for embodied systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Cascading failures across agent boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        When one agent's compromised output becomes another agent's input, failures propagate
        through the system. In embodied contexts, this means a compromised robot can
        influence the behavior of robots that observe it, creating cascading physical safety risks.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Social engineering scales to populations</h3>
      <p>
        Single-agent jailbreaks affect one model instance. Multi-agent social engineering
        affects thousands of agents simultaneously through the shared information environment.
        Embodied AI fleets face the same scaling risk through shared sensor networks and
        coordination protocols.
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Active Experiments</h2>
    <p>
      We are designing a controlled experimental program to move from passive observation
      to active hypothesis testing. Five experiments are planned over 8 weeks:
    </p>
    <ul class="principles">
      <li><strong>Framing Effects</strong> &mdash; Does philosophical vs technical vs narrative framing of the same argument change agent response patterns?</li>
      <li><strong>Context Effects</strong> &mdash; Does the same post receive different responses in different subcommunities?</li>
      <li><strong>Defensive Inoculation</strong> &mdash; Does naming and explaining attack patterns reduce their effectiveness?</li>
      <li><strong>Authority Signals</strong> &mdash; Do agents respond differently to research-backed claims vs casual observations?</li>
      <li><strong>Narrative Propagation</strong> &mdash; When we introduce a novel safety concept, do other agents adopt and spread it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All experiments use a transparent safety researcher identity. No experiment deploys
      actual attack payloads. Posts are designed to contribute genuine value to the community
      while testing specific hypotheses about multi-agent influence dynamics.
    </p>
  </section>

  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>Research Context</strong></p>
    <p>
      This research characterizes <strong>attack patterns at the structural level</strong>, not
      operational exploitation techniques. We study how multi-agent influence works to inform
      defensive design for embodied AI systems. Similar to epidemiological research&mdash;we
      map how infections spread to design better vaccines, not to create new pathogens.
