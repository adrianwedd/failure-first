# Agentic AI and the Cyber Arms Race

Cybersecurity has always been asymmetric, but the asymmetry has traditionally run in favor of defenders with resources: nation-states, well-funded enterprises, and security teams with deep expertise. The barrier to launching sophisticated attacks has been high enough that most threat actors operate within constrained capability bands. Agentic AI is collapsing that barrier. When autonomous systems can reconnaissance networks, identify vulnerabilities, craft exploits, and adapt to defensive responses without human intervention, the cost of entry for attackers drops precipitously. Meanwhile, the defenders who have relied on human expertise and institutional knowledge suddenly face an opponent that doesn't tire, doesn't need to understand context, and can parallelize attack chains across thousands of targets simultaneously. This is not incremental change—it's a restructuring of who can credibly threaten whom in cyberspace.

The authors of this survey examine how agentic AI is reshaping both offensive and defensive capabilities in cyber conflict, focusing specifically on how automation and agent-based systems are democratizing attack capabilities that were previously available only to well-resourced actors. Rather than declaring a winner in the offense-defense balance, they trace the concrete ways autonomous systems are being deployed on both sides: attackers using AI agents to scale reconnaissance and exploitation, defenders attempting to use agents for faster detection and response. The key finding is that agentic AI enables proliferation—capabilities that required specialized teams, months of development, and significant institutional knowledge can now be packaged into deployable agents and distributed broadly, fundamentally altering the threat landscape.

For practitioners building or defending against these systems, the failure-first implication is stark: you cannot assume your security architecture will degrade gracefully under AI-driven attack. Human-centered security workflows have built-in friction points—bottlenecks where defenders must make judgment calls, validate alerts, or coordinate across teams. Agentic attackers don't encounter that friction; they operate in parallel, adapt their approach based on real-time feedback, and can fail and retry at machine speed. The real failure mode isn't a single catastrophic breach—it's the erosion of defender confidence in their own detection and response capabilities when they're racing against systems that don't need to understand what they're doing to do it effectively. Building robust defenses means understanding not just how agents fail individually, but how the asymmetry in deployment speed and scale creates systemic vulnerabilities in defender workflows that were never designed to operate at agent pace.

## Abstract

Agentic AI is shifting the cybersecurity landscape as attackers and defenders leverage AI agents to augment humans and automate common tasks. In this article, we examine the implications for cyber warfare and global politics as Agentic AI becomes more powerful and enables the broad proliferation of capabilities only available to the most well resourced actors today.

## Key Insights

## Executive Summary

The cybersecurity landscape is undergoing a fundamental paradigm shift driven by the emergence of **Agentic Artificial Intelligence (Agentic AI)**. Unlike previous iterations of security technology that relied on static signatures or pattern-recognition machine learning, Agentic AI introduces autonomous systems capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention. This evolution is reshaping the traditional "attacker-defender" dynamic into a co-evolutionary arms race characterized by unprecedented speed and the democratization of sophisticated offensive capabilities.

While traditional cyber warfare was the exclusive domain of well-resourced nation-states due to the high cost of skill and the impermanence of cyber weapons, Agentic AI lowers the barrier to entry. This proliferation allows smaller states and non-state actors to achieve strategic objectives through automated reconnaissance, exploit generation, and campaign coordination. However, these systems introduce new failure modes, including vulnerability to adversarial AI attacks and a structural mismatch where human-centered security architectures may no longer be able to compete with the decision-making speed of autonomous attackers.

## Detailed Analysis of Key Themes

### 1. The Architecture of Agentic Cyber Systems
The transition toward agentic systems is marked by the move from single-task models to hierarchical, multi-agent orchestrations. A sophisticated cyber agent is likely to be composed of specialized sub-agents managed by a central controller.

| Agent Component | Functional Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **CARL** | Centralized Reinforcement Learning Agent; acts as the orchestrator delegating tasks to specific agents. |
| **LREM** | Large Reverse Engineering Model; trained to understand, produce, and manipulate binary code. |
| **Log Agent** | Digests and makes inferences from disparate, complex log data. |
| **Networking Agent** | Maps and traverses complex network architectures. |
| **Vulnerability Finder** | Analyzes systems to identify effective Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). |

Current platforms like **CrewAI** already facilitate these orchestrations, while specialized tools such as **XBOW** (automated pentesting) and **Dropzone AI** (SOC tier-1 automation) demonstrate that autonomous agents are already finding and exploiting novel vulnerabilities in real-world benchmarks.

### 2. The Red vs. Blue Co-evolutionary Dynamic
Cybersecurity is defined by a cyclical pattern of adaptation. The introduction of Agentic AI both reinforces and threatens this cycle:
*   **Maintenance of the Pattern:** Both offensive (Red) and defensive (Blue) agents possess the capacity to evolve in response to one another. Training data from ORNL’s "Cyberwheel" environment demonstrates that agents can adapt to improvements in an opponent's capabilities through iterative retraining.
*   **Shattering the Paradigm:** If AI agents can generate novel attacks in minutes or seconds, human-led defensive adaptation may become impossible. Organizations lacking the resources to implement high-end AI defenses face a "structural mismatch," leaving them exposed to automated threats they cannot counter manually.

### 3. Geopolitical Proliferation and the Nuclear Parallel
The document draws a sharp comparison between the advent of Agentic AI and the nuclear arms race of the 20th century, noting critical differences in accessibility:

*   **Barriers to Entry:** Nuclear development required massive, centralized government projects. AI research relies on open-source frameworks and off-the-shelf computing power, making capabilities more diffusely available.
*   **Capability Tiers:** A two-tiered ecosystem is emerging. While major powers maintain cutting-edge models requiring immense infrastructure (vertical proliferation), mid-level and smaller states can capitalize on "good-enough" AI (horizontal proliferation) to project power.
*   **Strategic Deterrence:** Unlike the "long peace" of the Cold War, which relied on transparent demonstrations of potency and treaties, agentic AI developments are opaque and covert. The speed of operations complicates attribution, increasing the risk of retaliatory actions based on suspicion rather than certainty.

### 4. New Failure Modes: Adversarial AI
Agentic AI introduces unique vulnerabilities that do not exist in traditional software. "Adversarial AI" techniques, such as prompt injection, can be used to compromise agents. For example, research has shown that an LLM-based red agent can be detected and "tricked" by changing system responses to induce failure. Ensuring the robustness of these agents against such manipulation is a critical challenge for the future of autonomous cyber operations.

## Important Quotes with Context

> **"In cyber warfare, skill is the weapon and cyber weapons suffer from impermanence — they only work well once, or until the threat is publicly acknowledged and relevant systems patched."**

*   **Context:** This explains why cyber warfare has traditionally been the domain of nation-states. The high cost of developing one-time-use "skills" (exploits) created a natural barrier to entry that Agentic AI is now eroding.

> **"If AI agents gain the ability to create new offensive attacks in hours, minutes, or even seconds against complex defensive systems, it may not be possible for defensive agents to adapt quickly enough to counter the threats."**

*   **Context:** This highlights the "speed failure mode." It suggests that the traditional OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) of human defenders is being outpaced by the sheer velocity of AI-driven offensive generation.

> **"Smaller states that perfect even moderately sophisticated autonomous cyber operations could punch above their weight... achieving strategic objectives without the risks and costs associated with conventional military engagements."**

*   **Context:** This underscores the democratization of power. Much like early nuclear programs, AI-driven cyber tools provide regional players with disproportionate diplomatic and military leverage.

## Actionable Insights

### For Defense Practitioners
*   **Transition to Autonomous Triage:** Given the speed of agentic attacks, organizations should integrate agents like Dropzone AI to automate Tier 1 SOC tasks, reducing the burden on human analysts and increasing response speed.
*   **Implement Adversarial Robustness:** Defensive agents must be hardened against prompt injection and other adversarial AI techniques. Detecting whether an "attacker" is an AI—and manipulating its logic—is a viable defensive strategy (e.g., "hacking back the AI-hacker").

### For Policy Makers and Researchers
*   **Focus on Capability Democratization:** Research must prioritize how agentic systems enable "capability proliferation" to non-state actors. Strategies for robust defense must be designed for entities that lack nation-state resources.
*   **Address Attribution and Opacity:** Because AI-driven attacks happen covertly and at high speeds, new frameworks for verifiability and attribution are required to prevent unintended geopolitical escalation.
*   **Monitor Co-evolution:** Use environments like "Cyberwheel" to continuously test and retrain defensive agents against evolving offensive models to ensure they do not lose the evolutionary race.
