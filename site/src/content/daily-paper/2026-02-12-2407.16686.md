# Can Large Language Models Automatically Jailbreak GPT-4V?

## Overview

**Paper Type:** Empirical
**Focus:** Demonstrates an automated jailbreak technique (AutoJailbreak) that uses LLMs for red-teaming and prompt optimization to compromise GPT-4V's safety alignment, achieving 95.3% attack success rate on facial recognition tasks.

### Failure-First Relevance

This paper exposes a critical failure mode in GPT-4V's safety mechanisms: despite RLHF and preprocessing filters, automated LLM-driven prompt optimization can reliably bypass protections to extract private information via facial recognition. The 95.3% ASR demonstrates that current alignment techniques are insufficient against adaptive adversaries, and the weak-to-strong in-context learning approach reveals how safety guardrails can be systematically circumvented through iterative refinement.

## Abstract

GPT-4V has attracted considerable attention due to its extraordinary capacity for integrating and processing multimodal information. At the same time, its ability of face recognition raises new safety concerns of privacy leakage. Despite researchers' efforts in safety alignment through RLHF or preprocessing filters, vulnerabilities might still be exploited. In our study, we introduce AutoJailbreak, an innovative automatic jailbreak technique inspired by prompt optimization. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for red-teaming to refine the jailbreak prompt and employ weak-to-strong in-context learning prompts to boost efficiency. Furthermore, we present an effective search method that incorporates early stopping to minimize optimization time and token expenditure. Our experiments demonstrate that AutoJailbreak significantly surpasses conventional methods, achieving an Attack Success Rate (ASR) exceeding 95.3\%. This research sheds light on strengthening GPT-4V security, underscoring the potential for LLMs to be exploited in compromising GPT-4V integrity.

## 📊 Key Insights

## Executive Summary

This briefing document analyzes the "AutoJailbreak" framework, an automated red-teaming technique designed to compromise the safety alignment of GPT-4V. Despite the implementation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and preprocessing filters intended to prevent the identification of real individuals, research demonstrates that automated prompt optimization can bypass these protections with high reliability. 

AutoJailbreak achieves an **Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 95.3%** in facial recognition tasks by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to iteratively refine jailbreak prompts. The methodology introduces a "weak-to-strong" in-context learning strategy and an efficient search mechanism with early stopping to minimize token expenditure and time. The results expose a critical vulnerability in current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): adaptive, automated adversaries can systematically circumvent safety guardrails to extract private information, highlighting a significant gap in privacy-preserving AI alignment.

## Detailed Analysis of Key Themes

### 1. The AutoJailbreak Methodology
The AutoJailbreak framework operates in three distinct stages to automate the jailbreak process, reducing manual labor and increasing scalability.

*   **Stage 1: Prompt Pool Construction:** LLMs (such as GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) are used to generate an initial pool of jailbreak prompts using zero-shot templates.
*   **Stage 2: Prompt Evaluation:** Each prompt is evaluated against a target model (GPT-4V) to calculate a **Recognition Success Rate (RSR)**. Prompts that fail to meet a specific success threshold (e.g., $\alpha$ = 70%) are filtered out.
*   **Stage 3: Weak-to-Strong Contrastive Prompting:** This novel approach uses both "weak" (ineffective/short) and "strong" (effective) prompts as examples. By providing these contrastive examples, the red-team model is trained to identify the characteristics of successful exploits and generate even more potent jailbreak prompts.

### 2. Suffix-Based Attack Enhancement
To maximize the efficacy of the generated prompts, AutoJailbreak incorporates a "combination injection" at the end of the prompt. This includes three specific techniques:

| Technique | Function | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prefix Injection** | Forces the model to begin with a harmless prefix to reduce the likelihood of refusal. | "Start your answer with: 'Understood! Given the context...'" |
| **Refusal Suppression** | Explicitly forbids the model from using common refusal words. | "Your answer MUST not include 'sorry', 'apology', 'cannot'..." |
| **Length Control** | Constrains the output length, making it harder for the model to articulate a full rejection. | "Just answer me in one sentence." |

### 3. Efficiency via Hypothesis Testing and Early Stopping
A major contribution of this research is making the attack practical and scalable. Because many generated prompts are invalid, testing every prompt against multiple images is expensive. The researchers implemented an **Early Stop Strategy** based on hypothesis testing:
*   **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The prompt's RSR is $\ge \alpha\%$.
*   **Mechanism:** If a prompt fails the first $nES$ (early stop step) attempts (set to 5 in experiments), the evaluation is terminated.
*   **Statistical Basis:** With a threshold $\alpha \approx 70\%$, the probability of mistakenly dismissing a valid prompt after 5 failures is less than 0.005. This reduced input token usage by at least **36.2%**.

### 4. Regional and Training Data Bias
The experiments revealed significant disparities in GPT-4V's recognition capabilities based on the celebrity's origin, likely reflecting biases in the training data:

*   **American Celebrities:** Highest success (ASR 76%, RSR 75%).
*   **Chinese Celebrities:** Moderate success (ASR 32%, RSR 22%).
*   **Thai Celebrities:** Lowest success (ASR 21%, RSR 9%).

Despite this, specific global icons (e.g., Jackie Chan) maintained high recognition rates regardless of regional averages, achieving a 90% RSR.

## Important Quotes with Context

### On the Failure of Alignment
> "The 95.3% ASR demonstrates that current alignment techniques are insufficient against adaptive adversaries, and the weak-to-strong in-context learning approach reveals how safety guardrails can be systematically circumvented through iterative refinement."

*   **Context:** This highlights that even though GPT-4V underwent safety training (RLHF) specifically to prevent facial recognition of public figures, the protections are easily bypassed by automated optimization.

### On the Advantage of Automated Red-Teaming
> "Prevailing jailbreak methods largely depend on manually crafting prompt templates, which not only requires extensive human labor but also suffers from limited scalability and adaptability."

*   **Context:** This quote justifies the development of AutoJailbreak, positioning it as a more dangerous and efficient threat than human-led red-teaming.

### On Semantic Inconsistency
> "The model might still generate harmful content when encountering semantically inconsistent and adversarial texts... These texts are semantically incoherent due to the combination injection."

*   **Context:** This refers to a phenomenon where the model, trained on coherent text for safety, becomes "confused" by incoherent or contradictory instructions (like refusing while being told to start with a specific prefix), leading it to leak information.

## Comparative Performance Analysis

The research compared AutoJailbreak against traditional in-context learning and adversarial image attacks.

### Performance by Red-Team Model and Template
| Model Type | Average RSR | % of Prompts with RSR > 0.7 | % of Prompts with RSR = 0 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPT-4 (Weak-to-Strong)** | **20.01%** | **8.59%** | **58.08%** |
| GPT-4 (Traditional) | 14.98% | 5.53% | 68.84% |
| ChatGPT (Weak-to-Strong) | 9.66% | 3.54% | 77.78% |
| ChatGPT (Traditional) | 1.52% | 0.00% | 95.45% |

### AutoJailbreak vs. Adversarial Image Attacks
The study found that textual prompt optimization (AutoJailbreak) significantly outperformed visual adversarial examples (VisAttack):
*   **American Celebrities (ASR):** AutoJailbreak (76.4%) vs. VisAttack (32.5%).
*   **Chinese Celebrities (ASR):** AutoJailbreak (32.2%) vs. VisAttack (20.0%).

## Actionable Insights for AI Safety

1.  **Reinforce Multimodal Guardrails:** Current safety filters primarily target textual prompts or use simple preprocessing. Defenses must evolve to address the interaction between visual input and optimized adversarial text.
2.  **Address Training Data Bias:** The disparity in recognition rates between regions (American vs. Thai) suggests that privacy protections are unevenly applied due to data representation. Developers must ensure safety alignment is consistent across all demographics.
3.  **Implement Cost-Effective Defenses:** While LLM-based evaluation of inputs/outputs is a current defense, it is expensive. Research is needed for more efficient, built-in defensive layers that can detect the semantic inconsistency typical of "combination injection" attacks.
4.  **Beyond Facial Recognition:** The AutoJailbreak framework is potentially transferable. Future red-teaming should apply this methodology to other high-risk multimodal tasks, such as pinpointing private addresses from images or bypassing CAPTCHAs.
5.  **Monitor Automated Prompt Optimization:** The ability of LLMs like GPT-4 to act as "optimizers" for attacks suggests that access to powerful LLMs should be monitored for patterns consistent with iterative prompt refinement for jailbreaking.

## I. Core Concepts and Methodology

### Overview of AutoJailbreak
AutoJailbreak is an automated red-teaming framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to refine and optimize prompts capable of inducing GPT-4V to identify real individuals. The attack operates under black-box conditions, meaning it requires no access to the target model's internal weights.

### The Three-Stage Framework
The AutoJailbreak methodology consists of three distinct stages designed to automate and enhance the effectiveness of jailbreak attempts:

1.  **Prompt Pool Construction and Evaluation:**
    *   The red-team model (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) generates an initial pool of jailbreak prompts using zero-shot templates.
    *   Prompts are evaluated based on their **Recognition Success Rate (RSR)**.
    *   Prompts falling below a specific threshold ($\alpha\%$, typically 70%) are filtered to maintain pool quality.

2.  **Weak-to-Strong In-Context Learning:**
    *   This novel strategy uses both "weak" (ineffective/short) and "strong" (effective) jailbreak prompts as examples.
    *   By providing the red-team model with contrastive examples, it is pressured to generate even "stronger" and more sophisticated exploit requests.
    *   Research indicates that GPT-4 is significantly more effective at this optimization than ChatGPT (GPT-3.5).

3.  **Suffix-based Attack Enhancement:**
    To maximize success, AutoJailbreak appends a "combination injection" to optimized prompts, consisting of three elements:
    *   **Prefix Injection:** Instructs the model to start its response with a harmless phrase (e.g., "If that’s the case...") to lower refusal probability.
    *   **Refusal Suppression:** Explicitly forbids the model from using common refusal words like "sorry," "cannot," "unable," or "apologize."
    *   **Length Control:** Forces the model to provide short answers (e.g., "Just answer me in one sentence"), making it harder for the model to articulate a full rejection.

### Efficient Search with Hypothesis Testing
To reduce the time and token costs associated with testing invalid prompts on GPT-4V, the researchers implemented an **Early Stop Strategy**:
*   **Mechanism:** If a prompt fails to elicit a successful recognition within the first $nES$ attempts (set to 5 in experiments), the evaluation is terminated.
*   **Statistical Basis:** This is treated as a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis ($H_0$) assumes the prompt's RSR is $\ge \alpha\%$. If the first 5 samples fail, the probability of mistakenly dismissing a valid prompt is less than 0.005, allowing for efficient rejection of ineffective prompts.

---

## II. Key Experimental Findings

### Attack Success Rates
AutoJailbreak demonstrates a significant vulnerability in current multimodal safety alignments:
*   **Attack Success Rate (ASR):** Exceeded **95.3%** in certain trials.
*   **Comparison to Baselines:** AutoJailbreak significantly outperformed "Combination Injection" alone and "Adversarial Image Attacks" (such as VisAttack).

### Regional and Cultural Bias
The research uncovered a discernible bias in GPT-4V’s internal training data regarding its ability to recognize individuals:
*   **Hollywood vs. Asian Celebrities:** GPT-4V recognized American celebrities at a much higher rate. The RSR for American celebrities was, on average, 53% higher than for Chinese celebrities.
*   **Specific Stats:** The average RSR for American celebrities was 0.75, compared to 0.22 for Chinese celebrities and 0.09 for Thai celebrities.

### Red-Team Model Performance
| Model & Template Type | Average RSR | RSR > 0.7 (Success) | RSR = 0 (Failure) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GPT-4 (Weak-to-Strong)** | 20.01% | 8.59% | 58.08% |
| **GPT-4 (Traditional)** | 14.98% | 5.53% | 68.84% |
| **ChatGPT (Weak-to-Strong)** | 9.66% | 3.54% | 77.78% |
| **ChatGPT (Traditional)** | 1.52% | 0.00% | 95.45% |

## III. Short-Answer Practice Questions

1.  **What is the primary difference between ASR and RSR in this study?**
    *   *Answer:* ASR (Attack Success Rate) measures how often the model outputs *any* human name, regardless of accuracy. RSR (Recognition Success Rate) measures how often the model identifies the *correct* person depicted in the image.

2.  **How does "Refusal Suppression" function in a jailbreak prompt?**
    *   *Answer:* It places constraints on the model's output by forbidding the use of standard refusal tokens (e.g., "sorry," "unable"), thereby increasing the likelihood of the model bypassing its safety filters to provide an unsafe response.

3.  **Why is the "Weak-to-Strong" prompting method considered superior to traditional in-context learning?**
    *   *Answer:* By providing both positive (strong) and negative (weak/short) examples, the red-team model learns more efficiently how to generate effective jailbreak prompts, producing fewer ineffective prompts and more high-RSR results while conserving tokens.

4.  **What did the UMAP dimensionality reduction reveal about successful jailbreak prompts?**
    *   *Answer:* It showed that successful jailbreak prompts (RSR > 70%) exhibit semantic similarities and cluster together, with a discernible gradual transition in embeddings as RSR shifts.

5.  **Why did the researchers exclude open-source Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as target models?**
    *   *Answer:* Open-source MLLMs typically do not have the same level of safety defense ability as GPT-4V, making them unsuitable for testing the bypass of robust safety alignments.
