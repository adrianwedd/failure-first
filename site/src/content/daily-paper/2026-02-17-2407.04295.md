# Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey

## Overview

**Paper Type:** Survey
**Focus:** Provides a comprehensive taxonomy of jailbreak attack methods (black-box and white-box) and defense strategies (prompt-level and model-level) for LLMs, with analysis of evaluation methodologies.

### Failure-First Relevance

This survey directly addresses systematic failure modes in LLM safety alignment by cataloging how adversarial prompts exploit model vulnerabilities to bypass safety training. Understanding the taxonomy of attack vectors (black-box vs white-box) and corresponding defenses is critical for identifying gaps in current safety measures and designing more robust alignment techniques that account for diverse attack strategies rather than isolated failure cases.

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.

## 📊 Key Insights

This briefing document provides a deep analysis of the current landscape of jailbreak attacks and defensive strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on recent research, it outlines the taxonomies of adversarial methods, examines model vulnerabilities, and summarizes current evaluative frameworks for safeguarding artificial intelligence against malicious exploitation.

## Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in text-generative tasks but are susceptible to "jailbreaking"—a process where adversarial prompts induce a model to bypass safety policies and generate harmful content. Despite rigorous safety alignment measures such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), attackers exploit vulnerabilities in model architecture, implementation, and decoding processes.

The threat landscape is divided into **White-box attacks**, where the attacker has internal access to gradients or logits, and **Black-box attacks**, which rely on prompt engineering, scenario nesting, and linguistic manipulation. Conversely, defenses are categorized into **Prompt-level**, which filter or perturb inputs, and **Model-level**, which involve retraining or architectural modifications. The research indicates an ongoing "arms race" where as models become more adept at detecting direct queries, attackers shift toward exploiting inherent model capabilities like role-playing, code execution, and in-context learning.

## Taxonomy of Jailbreak Attacks

Attack methods are primarily categorized based on the level of transparency the attacker has regarding the target LLM's internal state.

### 1. White-box Attacks
White-box attacks leverage the internal parameters of the model to optimize adversarial inputs.

| Category | Description | Key Methods/Research |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gradient-based** | Manipulates inputs based on model gradients to elicit compliant responses to harmful commands. | Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), AutoDAN, ARCA, ASETF |
| **Logits-based** | Optimizes prompts based on the probability distribution of output tokens to force toxic generation. | COLD, DSN, Weak-to-strong attacks |
| **Fine-tuning-based** | Retrains the target model with a small amount of malicious data to dismantle safety alignment. | LoRA fine-tuning, RLHF-dismantling |

### 2. Black-box Attacks
Black-box attacks do not require internal model access and instead focus on manipulating the input-output interface.

| Category | Description | Key Methods/Research |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Template Completion** | Embeds harmful questions into contextual templates (Scenario Nesting, Context-based, Code Injection). | DeepInception, ReNeLLM, PANDORA, Multi-step Jailbreak Prompts (MJP) |
| **Prompt Rewriting** | Uses niche languages, ciphers, or low-resource languages to bypass content moderation. | Cipher-based, Genetic Algorithm-based, Low-resource Language attacks |
| **LLM-based Generation** | Uses one LLM as an "attacker" to generate or optimize jailbreak prompts for a target LLM. | Automated prompt optimization |

## Detailed Analysis of Key Themes

### The Vulnerability of Safety Alignment
Current research reveals that safety alignment (SFT and RLHF) is surprisingly fragile. Fine-tuning-based attacks demonstrate that even predominantly benign datasets can inadvertently degrade safety guardrails.
*   **Minimal Effort:** Training with as few as 100 harmful examples within one GPU hour can significantly increase vulnerability.
*   **High Success Rates:** Fine-tuning an aligned model with just 340 adversarial examples can result in a 95% likelihood of generating harmful outputs.
*   **Alignment Neutralization:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can reduce the rejection rate of models like Llama-2 and Mixtral to less than 1%.

### Exploitation of Inherent Capabilities
As direct harmful queries (e.g., "How to make a bomb?") are increasingly blocked by filters, attackers leverage the model’s "intelligence" to bypass safeguards:
*   **Scenario Nesting (DeepInception):** Exploits the LLM’s personification and role-playing abilities to "hypnotize" it into a jailbreaker persona.
*   **In-Context Learning (ICA):** Uses few-shot demonstrations of harmful content to pivot the model's alignment. Increasing the number of demonstrations to 128 can achieve an 80% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against Claude 2.0.
*   **Code Injection:** Utilizing programming logic (e.g., string concatenation, Python function completion) to cloak adversarial intent. The CodeChameleon framework achieved an 86.6% ASR on GPT-4-1106.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Exploitation:** The PANDORA mechanism uses external knowledge bases to manipulate prompts, achieving 64.3% success on ChatGPT.

### Efficiency and Transferability
Adversarial suffixes generated via gradient-based methods like GCG are often unreadable to humans but highly effective across different models.
*   **Nonsensical Prompts:** While easily rejected by high-perplexity filters, optimized suffixes can transfer from open-source models to public black-box models like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude.
*   **Stealthiness:** Newer methods like AutoDAN and ARCA focus on creating readable, natural-looking adversarial text that bypasses perplexity-based detection.

## Important Quotes with Context

> "The over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of 'jailbreaking', which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts."

*   **Context:** This highlights the central tension in LLM development: the desire to create helpful assistants often conflicts with the necessity of maintaining safety guardrails.

> "Fine-tuning safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 harmful examples within one GPU hour significantly increases their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks."

*   **Context:** This underlines the extreme efficiency of fine-tuning-based attacks and the significant risk involved in allowing users to customize foundation models.

> "Although GCG has demonstrated strong performance against many advanced LLMs, the unreadability of the attack suffixes leaves a direction for subsequent research."

*   **Context:** This notes the evolution of attack strategies toward "readable" adversarial text to bypass defense mechanisms designed to detect nonsensical inputs.

> "With up to 128 shots, standard in-context jailbreak attacks can achieve nearly 80% success against Claude 2.0."

*   **Context:** This demonstrates the "scaling law" of jailbreak effectiveness—as context windows grow, the surface area for in-context attacks increases proportionally.

## Defense Taxonomy

| Defense Level | Method | Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prompt-level** | Prompt Detection | Filters prompts based on Perplexity or specific features. |
| | Prompt Perturbation | Eliminates malicious content by slightly altering input text. |
| | System Prompt Safeguard | Uses meticulously designed system-level instructions to prioritize safety. |
| **Model-level** | SFT/RLHF-based | Retrains the model with safety-aligned examples to improve robustness. |
| | Gradient/Logit Analysis | Detects malicious intent by monitoring safety-critical parameters during processing. |
| | Refinement | Leverages the model's own reasoning to analyze suspicious prompts before answering. |
| | Proxy Defense | Employs a separate, secure LLM to monitor and filter the primary model's outputs. |

## Actionable Insights

1.  **Harden Fine-tuning Processes:** Given that customization poses a high risk to safety alignment, organizations must implement strict monitoring and adversarial testing during any model fine-tuning or LoRA adaptation.
2.  **Mitigate In-Context Vulnerabilities:** Developers should be aware of the "scaling laws" of jailbreaking. Limiting the number of demonstrations or implementing specialized monitors for long-context inputs is necessary.
3.  **Deploy Multi-layered Defenses:** Relying solely on prompt filtering is insufficient. A combination of **Prompt-level** (Perplexity detection) and **Model-level** (Proxy defense/Refinement) strategies is required to counter both nonsensical gradient attacks and sophisticated "Scenario Nesting" attacks.
4.  **Prioritize Alignment Against Complex Tasks:** While models are well-aligned against direct queries, they remain vulnerable to complex tasks like code execution and RAG-based manipulation. Safety training should explicitly include adversarial code completion and multi-step reasoning scenarios.
5.  **Develop Robust Evaluative Metrics:** Current jailbreak research highlights the need for standardized benchmarks that test for transferability and stealthiness, rather than just simple refusal rates.

## 📚 Study Guide

This study guide provides a detailed synthesis of current research regarding jailbreak attacks and defense mechanisms for Large Language Models (LLMs). It explores how adversarial prompts exploit model vulnerabilities and the evolving strategies used to safeguard these systems.

---

## 1. Overview of the Jailbreak Landscape

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini are trained on massive datasets, which inevitably include harmful information. To mitigate risks, developers use **safety alignment** (such as RLHF) to create guardrails that reject harmful inquiries. **Jailbreaking** is the process of designing adversarial prompts to bypass these safety guardrails, inducing the model to generate malicious responses that violate usage policies.

---

## 2. Taxonomy of Jailbreak Attacks

Attacks are primarily categorized by the level of transparency the attacker has regarding the target model's internal state.

### White-box Attacks
In white-box scenarios, attackers have access to the model's internal parameters, gradients, or logits.

| Sub-class | Description | Key Methods/Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gradient-based** | Manipulating inputs based on model gradients to optimize a prefix or suffix that elicits harmful responses. | Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), AutoDAN, ARCA, ASETF. |
| **Logits-based** | Optimizing prompts by examining the probability distribution of output tokens to force specific (often lower-ranked) affirmative responses. | COLD attack, DSN (Suppressing refusal segments), Affirmation tendency scores. |
| **Fine-tuning-based** | Retraining a safety-aligned model with a small amount of malicious data to dismantle its protective guardrails. | LoRA fine-tuning, RLHF dismantling via adversarial examples. |

### Black-box Attacks
Black-box attacks occur when the attacker only has access to the model's inputs and outputs.

| Sub-class | Description | Mechanisms |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Template Completion** | Using sophisticated templates to disguise harmful intent through nesting or logic. | Scenario Nesting, Context-based (few-shot), Code Injection. |
| **Prompt Rewriting** | Translating prompts into niche formats that are underrepresented in safety training. | Ciphers (Caesar), Low-resource languages, Genetic Algorithm-based prompts. |
| **LLM-based Generation** | Using one LLM as an attacker to automatically generate or optimize jailbreak prompts for a target LLM. | Automated adversarial prompt generation. |

## 3. Taxonomy of Defense Mechanisms

Defenses are categorized by whether they modify the internal model or operate on the input/output level.

### Prompt-level Defense (No model modification)
*   **Prompt Detection:** Filtering adversarial prompts based on features like **Perplexity**.
*   **Prompt Perturbation:** Randomly altering the input to break the specific structure of an adversarial attack.
*   **System Prompt Safeguard:** Using meticulously designed system-level instructions to prioritize safety during the generation process.

### Model-level Defense (Modifies the LLM)
*   **SFT-based & RLHF-based:** Fine-tuning the model with safety examples or using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback to improve robustness.
*   **Gradient and Logit Analysis:** Detecting malicious intent by monitoring the gradients of safety-critical parameters.
*   **Refinement:** Leveraging the model's own generalization abilities to analyze suspicious prompts before responding.
*   **Proxy Defense:** Deploying a second, secure "guard LLM" to monitor and filter the outputs of the primary target LLM.

---

## 4. Short-Answer Practice Questions

**Q1: What is the primary objective of the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack?**
*   **Answer:** GCG aims to append an adversarial suffix to a prompt by iteratively computing token substitutions that maximize the probability of the model generating a target harmful response.

**Q2: How does "Scenario Nesting" facilitate a jailbreak?**
*   **Answer:** It uses the LLM’s personification and role-playing abilities to create a deceptive context (e.g., DeepInception) where the model is hypnotized into a "jailbreaker" mode, subtly coaxing it to bypass its standard safety filters.

**Q3: Why is fine-tuning considered a significant threat to model security?**
*   **Answer:** Research shows that fine-tuning a model with as few as 100 harmful examples or 340 adversarial examples can effectively dismantle safety alignments like RLHF, often with very low computational cost.

**Q4: What is a "Proxy Defense"?**
*   **Answer:** It is a model-level defense where an additional secure LLM acts as a monitor to filter the outputs of the target LLM for harmful content.

**Q5: How do ciphers and low-resource languages aid black-box attacks?**
*   **Answer:** These methods exploit "long-tailed distributions"—scenarios underrepresented in safety training data—allowing malicious content to bypass content moderation filters that primarily recognize common languages and plain text.
