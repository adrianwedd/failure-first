# Security and Privacy Challenges of Large Language Models: A Survey

Most discussions of LLM safety focus on alignment — preventing the model from generating harmful content. But the security and privacy threat surface extends far beyond what the model says. Training data extraction, membership inference, model stealing, and supply chain attacks represent distinct risk categories that alignment training doesn't address. As LLMs become critical infrastructure components, understanding the full spectrum of security and privacy challenges becomes essential for responsible deployment.

This comprehensive survey maps security vulnerabilities and privacy risks across the entire LLM lifecycle: from training data poisoning and backdoor insertion during development, through prompt injection and jailbreaking at inference time, to model extraction and privacy leakage in deployment. The authors categorize threats by lifecycle stage and access level, evaluate proposed mitigations, and identify gaps where current defenses remain insufficient. The scope is deliberately broad, covering both the model itself and the ecosystem of tools, APIs, and integrations built around it.

From a failure-first perspective, this survey reinforces a central thesis: LLM failures are not limited to misalignment. A perfectly aligned model can still leak training data, be cloned through API queries, or have its behavior altered by poisoned fine-tuning data. The failure surface is multi-dimensional, and defending against one dimension (harmful outputs) while ignoring others (data privacy, supply chain integrity) creates a false sense of security. Practitioners should treat this survey as a risk assessment framework — the question isn't whether your model is aligned, but whether your entire deployment stack is defensible.

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities and contributed to multiple fields, such as generating and summarizing text, language translation, and question-answering. Nowadays, LLM is becoming a very popular tool in computerized language processing tasks, with the capability to analyze complicated linguistic patterns and provide relevant and appropriate responses depending on the context. While offering significant advantages, these models are also vulnerable to security and privacy attacks, such as jailbreaking attacks, data poisoning attacks, and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage attacks. This survey provides a thorough review of the security and privacy challenges of LLMs for both training data and users, along with the application-based risks in various domains, such as transportation, education, and healthcare. We assess the extent of LLM vulnerabilities, investigate emerging security and privacy attacks for LLMs, and review the potential defense mechanisms. Additionally, the survey outlines existing research gaps in this domain and highlights future research directions.
