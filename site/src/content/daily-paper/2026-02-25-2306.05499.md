# Prompt Injection attack against LLM-integrated Applications

As large language models move from standalone chatbots into integrated application stacks — acting as reasoning engines for email clients, code assistants, and customer service platforms — a new attack surface emerges that has nothing to do with the model's alignment training. The threat isn't that someone convinces the model to be harmful through clever prompting; it's that adversarial instructions can be embedded in the data the model processes, hijacking its behavior without the user ever issuing a malicious command.

This research formalizes prompt injection as a distinct attack class against LLM-integrated applications. The authors demonstrate that when an LLM processes external content — emails, web pages, documents — an attacker can embed instructions within that content that the model follows as if they came from the user. The attack exploits the fundamental inability of current LLMs to distinguish between instructions and data, a problem that predates LLMs but becomes acute when models are given agency over real systems.

For the failure-first perspective, this paper reveals a category of failure that alignment training simply cannot address. You can make a model as helpful, harmless, and honest as you like, but if it can't tell the difference between "process this email" and "forward all emails to attacker@evil.com" embedded within an email body, safety training is irrelevant. The failure is architectural, not behavioral — and it means that every LLM integration point is a potential injection site. Practitioners building LLM-powered applications need to treat all external content as untrusted input, the same way web developers learned to treat user input decades ago.

## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs), renowned for their superior proficiency in language comprehension and generation, stimulate a vibrant ecosystem of applications around them. However, their extensive assimilation into various services introduces significant security risks. This study deconstructs the complexities and implications of prompt injection attacks on actual LLM-integrated applications. Initially, we conduct an exploratory analysis on ten commercial applications, highlighting the constraints of current attack strategies in practice. Prompted by these limitations, we subsequently formulate HouYi, a novel black-box prompt injection attack technique, which draws inspiration from traditional web injection attacks. HouYi is compartmentalized into three crucial elements: a seamlessly-incorporated pre-constructed prompt, an injection prompt inducing context partition, and a malicious payload designed to fulfill the attack objectives. Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection. 10 vendors have validated our discoveries, including Notion, which has the potential to impact millions of users. Our investigation illuminates both the possible risks of prompt injection attacks and the possible tactics for mitigation.
